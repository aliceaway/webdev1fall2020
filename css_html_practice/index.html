  <h3> I was able to make the line above purple with a class element, but then it stopped being purple and I couldn't figure out how to make it purple again with class but for some reason an ID worked... wtf? So anyways that's why there's a class and an ID
  </h3>

<p> But I hope y'all aren't expecting this to make sense. I had the above line successfully purple before, but now it is not purple... so...</p>
<p>I mean it could end up being pretty poetic if I can figure out how to do line breaks etc.</p>

    Ok but real talk I could definitely format a poem the way I like to in this if I could just figure out how to indent lines 
  </h6>

<h7>Welp I didn't get to VW or VH but I kind of killed it up until that point.
