    <h1>My Review of the Internet in 2020</h1>
<h2>It gets 9/10</h2>


<p> So far, 2020 hasn’t impressed anyone, especially compared to every other year that has come before it. Overall, it gets a very low score (to the point where it can’t even really be rated) and doesn’t have my vote. That being said, 2020 has shed a new light on the importance, significance, reliability, and of course, credibility, of the internet. In years past, there has been some disagreement on the average amount of truth that the internet provides, but this year we have finally answered the question: “can I believe what the internet tells me?” and obviously, YES, you can.  </p>

<p>As much as we love to criticize, we can no longer debate the fact that the internet is the holy grail of truth. Whether it is scrolling through the president’s Twitter account, having a chat with our besties in our Q-Anon Facebook groups, or reading up on this whole Covid-19 hoax, we can rest assured we are getting the most up to date and profoundly accurate information from the internet. For this reason alone, I would rate the internet at a solid 9/10, and I only take that one point away because of how many neoliberal fanatics populate the internet. Other than that, could not recommend it more! Just make sure to never read CNN, The New York Times, BBC, Axios, or any of those other garbage communist atrocities that exist somewhere on the web... But overall, 9/10!  </p>
